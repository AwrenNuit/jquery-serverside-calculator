# Server-side jQuery Calculator

## Description
This server-side jQuery calculator was my weekend project for Week 2 onsite at Prime Digital Academy. It stores data from the button clicks client-side, then sends the data over to the server-side where it does the calculations before sending the results back to the client-side.

Try it out here: https://still-brook-78952.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies used
- Node.js
- jQuery
- JavaScript

## Future plans
- Fix weird JavaScript decimals
- Permanently position HISTORY to the right of the calculator
- Dry out the code more

Thank you to all the people (staff and student) who challenged and supported me with these new skills.

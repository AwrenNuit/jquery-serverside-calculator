## Server-side jQuery Calculator

## Description
This server-side jQuery calculator was my weekend project for Week 2 onsite at Prime Digital Academy. It stores data from the button clicks client-side, then sends the data over to the server-side where it does the calculations before sending the results back to the client-side.

## Technologies used
- Node.js
- jQuery
- Javascript

## Future plans
Eventually I want to fix the excessive decimals that Javascript sometimes outputs, keep the history bar permanently on the right side of the calculator (right now it shifts above the calculator with long numbers/decimals), and dry out the code some more.

Thank you to all the people (staff and student) who challenged and supported me with these new skills.
